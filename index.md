Here is **Jingjing An (Alyssia, 安静静)**.

I am a freshman graduate student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chengjun Wang](https://github.com/chengjun) in the [Socrates Group](https://github.com/SocratesClub).

My research interests are in computational narrative, and I hope to be able to connect with the world through data in order to write more powerful stories.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at ajj2000@126.com
