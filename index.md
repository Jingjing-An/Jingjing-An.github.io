# About Me

<img src="https://jingjing-an.github.io/anjingjing.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">



Here is **Jingjing An (安静静)**.

I am a freshman graduate student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chengjun Wang](https://github.com/chengjun) in the [Socrates Group](https://github.com/SocratesClub). 

My research interests are in computational narrative, and I hope to be able to connect with the world through data in order to write more powerful stories. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at ajj2000@126.com
