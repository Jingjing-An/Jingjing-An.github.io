<br>Nature removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being getting close to nature. By the way, it would be nice if I could get a paper published in Nature ( Just kidding ).




## My Cat

This is my kitten, his name is McLuhan, but we all call him Kitten ( 小猫 ) or Xiao Bao ( 小宝 ) . He is a cute kitten I adopted during my undergraduate studies. Taking care of him should be my life's hobby!



## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed badminton playing, vlog making, and movie watching. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.I hope to pick up these hobbies in my free time :D
